# AI_assist
 an autogen-based AI assistant that can create new tools and new agents. 
 
 It is based on the project Voyager: https://voyager.minedojo.org/

It requires the Qdrant vector database, Langchain, and Autogen.

This project is still in early development. Currently, the agents still can't develop skills correctly without exceeding the context window.
